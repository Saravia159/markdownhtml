# User Story

As a beginner markdown user, I want to create a user-story, so that I can become more familiar with the markdown syntax.

## User stories continued

1. As a user, I can click on a thumbs up so other users can see how many people like a user's post.

2.   As a user, I click on "User Settings" so that the user can change any settings to their individual profile at free will.

---

# Acceptance Criteria

1. Given that the user has made a post, when the thumbs up button is clicked, the user will inform that the post is liked.

2. Given that the user isn't on the user settings page, when click the "User Settings" button, the browser will redirect the user to user settings.
